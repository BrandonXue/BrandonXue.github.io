### Art Gallery Manager

A desktop application used to query a database for art gallery data such as art shows, artists, and artwork. This project is written in Java using Swing to create the user interfaces. It connects to a MySQL database using the Connector/J API. The database is hosted by ClearDB's services, and was set up through Heroku. Source code for setting up the database is also included.
